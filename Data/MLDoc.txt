Machine Learning (ML) — At a Glance
🔹 What is ML?

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) where computers learn patterns from data and make predictions/decisions without being explicitly programmed with rules.

Example: Instead of coding "if email has the word lottery, mark spam," an ML model learns from thousands of labeled spam/non-spam emails to detect spam automatically.

🔹 Categories of ML

Supervised Learning

Train on labeled data (input → output).

Goal: predict outcomes.

Examples:

Predicting house prices 🏠 (regression).

Email spam detection 📧 (classification).

Unsupervised Learning

Train on unlabeled data (only input).

Goal: find hidden structure.

Examples:

Customer segmentation in marketing 👥.

Topic clustering in documents 📚.

Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Agent learns by interacting with an environment (trial and error).

Goal: maximize reward.

Examples:

Self-driving cars 🚗.

Game playing (Chess, Go, Atari 🎮).

🔹 ML Workflow

Data Collection (CSV, databases, APIs).

Data Preprocessing (cleaning, normalization, handling missing values).

Feature Engineering (extracting meaningful variables).

Model Selection (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks).

Training (fit model to training data).

Evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, RMSE).

Deployment (serve model via API, integrate into apps).
